A pull request is also a place where you can have extended conversations about the changes between two branches. Letâ€™s say that Ali introduces a bug fix, but accidentally creates a new bug when resolving the fix. Sally can view this work, send a quick comment (on the pull request) to Ali identifying the new issue, and either fix the problem herself or give Ali a chance to make quick edits before merging. hh
